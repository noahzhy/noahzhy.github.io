# Welcome to my blog
#### Self-introduction
Welcome to my blog, and I hope that we can become friends. First of all, let me introduce myself. I'm Noah Zhang and majoring in Computer Science at Hanyang University. I set up this blog because I'd like to share and show something what I learned like Machine Learning or something else to like-minded friends. 

#### Code & What I'm doing right now
I'm partial to Python, Kotlin or Java for Android. And I'm coding something about Smart Home Hub. 

#### Contact
If you want to contact to me, you could email me at <noahzhy@gmail.com>. By the way, I can understand it if you write in Chinese, English or Korean.
